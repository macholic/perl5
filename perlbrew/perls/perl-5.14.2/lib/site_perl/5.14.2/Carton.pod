=head1 NAME

Carton - Perl module dependency manager (aka Bundler for Perl)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # On your development environment
  > cat Makefile.PL
  use inc::Module::Install;
  name 'MyApp';
  version '1.0';
  
  requires 'Plack', 0.9980;
  requires 'Starman', 0.2000;
  
  WriteAll;

  > carton install
  > git add Makefile.PL carton.lock
  > git commit -m "add Plack and Starman"

  # Other developer's machine, or on a deployment box
  > carton install
  > carton exec -Ilib -- starman -p 8080 myapp.psgi

=head1 DESCRIPTION

carton is a command line tool to track the Perl module dependencies
for your Perl application. The managed dependencies are tracked in a
I<carton.lock> file, which is meant to be version controlled, and the
lock file allows other developers of your application will have the
exact same versions of the modules.

=head1 TUTORIAL

=head2 Initializing the environment

carton will use the I<.carton> directory for local configuration and
the I<local> directory to install modules into. You're recommended to
exclude these directories from the version control system.

  > echo .carton/ >> .gitignore
  > echo local/ >> .gitignore
  > git add carton.lock
  > git commit -m "Start using carton"

=head2 Tracking the dependencies

You can manage the dependencies of your application via the standard
I<Makefile.PL> or I<Build.PL>.

  # Makefile.PL
  use inc::Module::Install;
  name 'MyAwesomeApp';
  requires 'Plack', 0.9980;
  requires 'Starman', 0.2000;
  WriteAll;

And then you can install these dependencies via:

  > carton install

The modules are installed into your I<local> directory, and the
dependencies tree and version information are analyzed and saved into
I<carton.lock> in your directory.

Make sure you add I<carton.lock> to your version controlled repository
and commit changes as you update dependencies. This will ensure that
other developers on your app, as well as your deployment environment,
use exactly the same versions of the modules you just installed.

  > git add Makefile.PL carton.lock
  > git commit -m "Added Plack and Starman"

You can aternatively install modules adhoc from the command line,
without managing the build file at all.

  > carton install Devel::NYTProf
  > carton install AnyEvent::Redis

carton will install these modules into I<local> directory in the same
way, and also can track and analyze the dependencies.

=head2 Deploying your application

Once you've done installing all the dependencies, you can push your
application directory to a remote machine (excluding I<local> and
I<.carton>) and run the following command:

  > carton install

This will look at the I<carton.lock> and install the exact same
versions of the dependencies into I<local>, and now your application
is ready to run.

=head2 Bundling modules

carton can bundle all the tarballs for your dependencies into a
directory so that you can even install dependencies that are not
available on CPAN, such as internal distribution aka DarkPAN.

  > carton bundle

will bundle these tarballs into I<local/cache> directory, and

  > carton install --cached

will install modules using this local cache. This way you can avoid a
dependency on CPAN meta DB and search.cpan.org at a deploy time, or
you can have dependencies onto private CPAN modules aka DarkPAN.
